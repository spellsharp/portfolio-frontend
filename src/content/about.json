  "I'm a passionate developer with a foot in both the web development and machine learning (ML) worlds. For the past 2 years, I've been building web applications and diving headfirst into the exciting world of ML. While web development provides a strong foundation for bringing ideas to life, my true fascination lies in the potential of ML, particularly in the areas of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative AI (GenAI).",
  "This portfolio showcases my web development skills alongside some of my personal ML projects. I'm constantly learning and exploring new possibilities in both fields, and I'm eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.",
  " When I'm not coding, you can find me singing carnatic music, gaming, or reading."
